Evaluation for homework 00: Greeter
   and Java Environment set up
   and GitHub repository set up/initialization
============================================

There must be a GitHub repository to which you have invited your humble
professor to collaborate.  The structure of the repository must be as is
specified in the assignment, including the name of the repo.  There must
be a "Greeter.java" source code file in the repository.  You do not need
to include the "Greeter.class" file unless you want to do so.  It will
be assumed that you have a working editor of some kind to create your
code and that it is configured correctly [no "funny" characters].  It will
also be assumed that you have a working Java installation so that your
compiler and JVM can execute your code.

============================================================================
Evaluation:
============================================================================
Maximum points: 8 out of 8 = 100% which is an A-plus

Java works        1.00 out of 1.00
Repo created      2.00 out of 2.00
Editor works      1.00 out of 1.00
Greeter runs      2.00 out of 2.00
Greeter in Repo   2.00 out of 2.00

Your score:
Total 8 out of 8 = 100% which is an A-plus


Explicit comments on the exercise:
----------------------------------
I'm not docking you points this time, but your repository is not structured
correctly.  You have a file called "homework 00" at the same level as your
"Greeter.java" file.  You need to create a FOLDER called "homework00" [note
that it does NOT have a space in it] and UNDER that folder is where you will
put your "Greeter.java" file.  That should be the form for all of the lab
assignments for the semester.

Also, your repo should be renamed to include your name in some form:

   cmsi-186_Jansky     OR     cmsi-186_Christorpher

....or something like.

Nice work!
